# P2P-WalkieTalkie
Android application using WiFi Direct (P2P) technology to transfer voice communication between (multiple) devices in real-time.

Idea and implementation of this project was first done as part of subject Wireless and Mobile Networks, undergraduate programme at Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana.

Project source code is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/tfajfar/bmo-p2p/src/DvosmerniPoizkus-Tine/) and it was contributed to by:

- [TGornik](https://bitbucket.org/%7Ba39272ba-7b2b-4c71-9bb2-a48c9a33efe1%7D/)
- [TFajfar](https://bitbucket.org/%7B0b329528-8b6d-47f0-ad5b-5971f320b847%7D/) - myself

Original project was meant to show us capabilities of WiFi P2P and it was not meant to be bug-less production ready version of application. This is what goal of this project is - to rework the app making it functional as one would expect it, resource efficient and user friendly.
